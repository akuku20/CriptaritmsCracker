# CriptaritmsCracker

Cryptarithms are puzzles where you are given an arithmetical expression where the digits have been replaced by letters, each digit a different letter. Your job is to ‘crack the code’, so to speak, to find out what is the digit that each letters represent.

This is a criptaritms solver written in Haskell language. 

To compile the code enter the command
```
ghc solver.hs 
```
and to solve the criptarithm written in text file
```
./solver [path to your input file]
```

Input requirements:
- words should contain only English letters
- words and operators should be divided by whitespaces
